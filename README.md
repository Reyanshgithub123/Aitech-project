# Disease Outbreak Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to predict disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. By analyzing health data, environmental factors, and population density, the system provides early warnings for potential outbreaks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures data for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses Random Forest for predicting outbreak risks.
- **Visualization**: Displays feature importance and outbreak risk assessment.
- **Alert System**: Notifies health officials of high-risk areas.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/example/disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python diseaseoutbreak.py
   ```

## Dataset
The system uses a CSV file (`disease_data.csv`) with the following columns:
- **temperature**: Average temperature of the region
- **humidity**: Humidity levels
- **population_density**: Number of people per square kilometer
- **healthcare_access**: Availability of healthcare facilities (scale: 1-5)
- **infected_neighbors**: Number of reported infections nearby
- **outbreak_risk**: Binary value (1 = High Risk, 0 = Low Risk)

## Usage
- Run the script to train the model and evaluate predictions.
- Use the `predict_outbreak` function with new data to get risk assessments.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with deep learning.
- Implement real-time data collection and cloud-based processing.
- Improve user interface for easier analysis.
